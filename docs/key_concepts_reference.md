## üìà Linear Regression Theory

### **Mathematical Foundation**
**Simple Linear Regression:**
```
Y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX + Œµ
```
Where:
- **Y**: Target variable (e.g., revenue)
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ**: Intercept (baseline value when X = 0)
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ**: Coefficient (slope, change in Y per unit change in X)
- **X**: Independent variable (e.g., marketing spend)
- **Œµ**: Error term (residuals)

**Multiple Linear Regression:**
```
Y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚ÇôX‚Çô + Œµ
```

### **Model Assumptions**
1. **Linearity**: Relationship between X and Y is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals
4. **Normality**: Residuals follow normal distribution

### **Business Interpretation**
- **Intercept (Œ≤‚ÇÄ)**: Baseline revenue when all factors are zero
- **Coefficients (Œ≤·µ¢)**: How much revenue changes for each unit change in the factor
- **R¬≤**: How much of revenue variation is explained by the model

## üéØ Model Evaluation Metrics

### **Error Metrics**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared difference between actual and predicted
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE, in original units
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Average absolute percent error

### **Goodness of Fit**
- **R¬≤ (R-squared)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Adjusted R¬≤**: R¬≤ adjusted for number of predictors
- **F-statistic**: Overall model significance test

### **Business Context**
- **Lower MSE/RMSE/MAE/MAPE** = Better predictions
- **Higher R¬≤/Adjusted R¬≤** = More variance explained
- **Use RMSE relative to average revenue** for business impact assessment

## üîß Advanced ML Concepts

### **Regularization**
**Purpose**: Prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms

**Types:**
- **Ridge (L2)**: Penalizes large coefficients, reduces multicollinearity
- **Lasso (L1)**: Encourages sparse models, performs feature selection
- **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties

**Business Impact**: More robust models that generalize better to new data

### **Multicollinearity**
**Definition**: High correlation between independent variables

**Detection:**
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) > 10
- Eigenvalue analysis

**Solutions:**
- Remove highly correlated features
- Use regularization (Ridge regression)
- Feature engineering to create orthogonal variables

### **Feature Engineering**
**Purpose**: Create meaningful variables from raw data

**Examples:**
- **Price Competitiveness**: `competitor_price - our_price`
- **Marketing Efficiency**: `revenue / marketing_spend`
- **Seasonal Marketing**: `marketing_spend √ó seasonal_factor`

**Business Value**: Captures complex relationships and improves model performance

## üìä Model Validation

### **Cross-Validation**
**Purpose**: Robust model assessment using multiple train/test splits

**Types:**
- **K-Fold**: Data split into K equal parts, train on K-1, test on 1
- **Leave-One-Out**: Each observation used as test set once
- **Time Series**: Respect temporal order for time-dependent data

**Business Value**: Ensures model reliability for business decision-making

### **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**
- **High Bias (Underfitting)**: Model too simple, misses patterns
- **High Variance (Overfitting)**: Model too complex, captures noise
- **Sweet Spot**: Optimal complexity for best generalization

**Business Impact**: Balance between accuracy and interpretability

## üöÄ Production Concepts

### **Model Drift**
**Definition**: Model performance degrades over time due to data changes

**Types:**
- **Data Drift**: Feature distributions change
- **Concept Drift**: Target variable patterns change
- **Performance Drift**: Model accuracy decreases

**Detection Methods:**
- Monitor prediction accuracy over time
- Track feature distribution changes
- Use statistical tests for drift detection

### **Hyperparameter Tuning**
**Purpose**: Optimize model parameters for best performance

**Methods:**
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over parameter grid
- **Random Search**: Random sampling from parameter space
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Efficient parameter space exploration

**Business Value**: Maximize model performance for business impact

## üíº Business Applications

### **Sales Forecasting**
**Application**: Predict future revenue for planning
**Features**: Historical sales, marketing spend, seasonality, promotions
**Business Impact**: 5-15% revenue increase through better planning

### **Demand Planning**
**Application**: Optimize inventory levels
**Features**: Sales history, seasonal patterns, marketing campaigns
**Business Impact**: 10-20% cost reduction in inventory management

### **Marketing ROI**
**Application**: Measure marketing effectiveness
**Features**: Marketing spend, channel performance, conversion rates
**Business Impact**: Optimize budget allocation across channels

### **Pricing Strategy**
**Application**: Understand price elasticity
**Features**: Product prices, competitor prices, sales volume
**Business Impact**: Maximize revenue through optimal pricing

## üîç Statistical Concepts

### **Correlation vs. Causation**
- **Correlation**: Statistical relationship between variables
- **Causation**: One variable directly affects another
- **Business Context**: Marketing spend correlates with sales, but doesn't guarantee causation

### **Confidence Intervals**
**Purpose**: Range where true parameter likely falls
**Business Use**: Communicate prediction uncertainty to stakeholders

### **P-values**
**Purpose**: Test statistical significance of relationships
**Interpretation**: p < 0.05 suggests significant relationship
**Business Context**: Ensure relationships are not due to chance
